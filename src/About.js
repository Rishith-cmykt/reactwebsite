Teams have to maintain the server hardware, take care of software and security updates, and create backups in case of failure. By adopting serverless architecture, developers can offload these responsibilities to a third-party provider, enabling them to focus on writing application code.There has been an ongoing search for technology that helps to reduce system overloading, data loss, and development costs. This search has resulted in serverless technology.

Serverless architecture runs on cloud technology, allowing users to run code for virtually any type of application or backend service with zero administration. No provisioning, managing, or upgrading servers is necessary. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the leading examples of companies using and providing serverless architecture.</span>
<h2 align='centre'>IOT</h2>
<p>Internet of Things, or IoT, is the network of devices (from vehicles to home appliances) that can be connected to the internet for interacting among themselves and exchanging data. The idea is that the Internet is not only for desktops and smartphones but for other physical things. Embedded with technology, these everyday objects can connect to the Internet, be remotely monitored, and controlled. The most well-known and wide-spread example of IoT is a smart home.

Smart home devices belong to a larger concept of automating home appliances with the hope of making human life easier. The long term benefits include saving energy, for example, when the lights automatically turn off if no one is present in the room, or improving health and safety.</p>
